# Important Notes:

## Removing Interceptors
 You learned how to add an interceptor, getting rid of one is also easy. Simply store the reference to the interceptor in a variable and call eject  with that reference as an argument, to remove it (more info: https://github.com/axios/axios#interceptors):
```
var myInterceptor = axios.interceptors.request.use(function () {/*...*/});
axios.interceptors.request.eject(myInterceptor);
```

## react-router vs react-router-dom
 We installed both react-router  and react-router-dom . Technically, only react-router-dom  is required for web development. It wraps react-router  and therefore uses it as a dependency. 

 We don't need to install react-router  on our own for it to work. You can omit this installation step, I left it in there for historic reasons and because I like to emphasize that the main package is named react-router. If you ever search for assistance, you probably want to search for "react router" - that's the name of the package.

## Absolute vs Relative Paths (Article)

You learned about <Link> , you learned about the to  property it uses.

The path you can use in to can be either absolute or relative. 

### Absolute Paths
By default, if you just enter to="/some-path"  or to="some-path" , that's an absolute path. 

Absolute path means that it's always appended right after your domain. Therefore, both syntaxes (with and without leading slash) lead to example.com/some-path .

### Relative Paths
Sometimes, you might want to create a relative path instead. This is especially useful, if your component is already loaded given a specific path (e.g. posts ) and you then want to append something to that existing path (so that you, for example, get /posts/new ).

If you're on a component loaded via /posts , to="new"  would lead to example.com/new , NOT example.com/posts/new . 

To change this behavior, you have to find out which path you're on and add the new fragment to that existing path. You can do that with the url  property of props.match :

<Link to={props.match.url + '/new'}>  will lead to example.com/posts/new  when placing this link in a component loaded on /posts . If you'd use the same <Link>  in a component loaded via /all-posts , the link would point to /all-posts/new .

There's no better or worse way of creating Link paths - choose the one you need. Sometimes, you want to ensure that you always load the same path, no matter on which path you already are => Use absolute paths in this scenario.

Use relative paths if you want to navigate relative to your existing path.

## Parsing Query Parameters & the Fragment
You learned how to extract route parameters (=> :id  etc). 

But how do you extract search (also referred to as "query") parameters (=> ?something=somevalue  at the end of the URL)? How do you extract the fragment (=> #something  at the end of the URL)?

### Query Params:
You can pass them easily like this:
```
<Link to="/my-path?start=5">Go to Start</Link> 

or

<Link 
    to={‌{
        pathname: '/my-path',
        search: '?start=5'
    }}
    >Go to Start</Link>
```
React router makes it easy to get access to the search string: props.location.search .

But that will only give you something like ?start=5 

You probably want to get the key-value pair, without the ?  and the = . Here's a snippet which allows you to easily extract that information:
```
componentDidMount() {
    const query = new URLSearchParams(this.props.location.search);
    for (let param of query.entries()) {
        console.log(param); // yields ['start', '5']
    }
}
```
URLSearchParams  is a built-in object, shipping with vanilla JavaScript. It returns an object, which exposes the entries()  method. entries()  returns an Iterator - basically a construct which can be used in a for...of...  loop (as shown above).

When looping through query.entries() , you get arrays where the first element is the key name (e.g. start ) and the second element is the assigned value (e.g. 5 ).

### Fragment:
You can pass it easily like this:
```
<Link to="/my-path#start-position">Go to Start</Link> 

or

<Link 
    to={‌{
        pathname: '/my-path',
        hash: 'start-position'
    }}
    >Go to Start</Link>
```
React router makes it easy to extract the fragment. You can simply access props.location.hash .
